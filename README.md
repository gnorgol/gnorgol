<p>🎓 I have a Master's degree in Video Game Development. This provided me a deep understanding of game design and development, and equipped me with skills in various programming languages </p>


<p>💻 I'm proficient in a range of programming languages including C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP. Whether it's coding game mechanics or designing web interfaces, I have the flexibility and knowledge to dive into any task.</p>

<p>🕹️ My passion lies in creating immersive experiences through games. I've worked with both Unity and Unreal Engine, two of the most powerful game engines out there. These tools have been crucial in helping me bring my ideas to life.</p>

<p>🎮 During my studies, I completed two major projects that I'm quite proud of:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Zuma Project</strong>: A fun and engaging game inspired by the classic Zuma. You can play it <a href="https://gnorgol.github.io/Zuma-Project/">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>TP Camera Project</strong>: An interactive camera-based game, demonstrating my skills in creating unique game mechanics. Check it out <a href="https://gnorgol.github.io/Tp-Cam-Web/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>🔗 You can also find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-norgol-51a7b5195/">LinkedIn</a>, where I share more about my professional experiences and connect with fellow developers.</p>

<p>🚀 I'm always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities. If you'd like to collaborate or just chat about game development, feel free to reach out to me!</p>
