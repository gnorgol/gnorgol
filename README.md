<p>🎓 I have a Master's degree in Video Game Development. This provided me a deep understanding of game design and development, and equipped me with skills in various programming languages </p>


<p>💻 I'm proficient in a range of programming languages including C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP. Whether it's coding game mechanics or designing web interfaces, I have the flexibility and knowledge to dive into any task.</p>

<p>🕹️ My passion lies in creating immersive experiences through games. I've worked with both Unity and Unreal Engine, two of the most powerful game engines out there. These tools have been crucial in helping me bring my ideas to life.</p>

<h2>🎮 Unreal Engine 5 Projects</h2>

<p>A standout project developed using Unreal Engine 5 is <strong>Slasher Dungeon</strong>: an adventure in a "soul-like" world. In this game, players venture into a dark and menacing dungeon, populated by formidable paladins. The game features intelligent and dynamic enemies and exciting discoveries throughout the journey.

<h2>🎮 Unity Projects</h2>

<p>🧙‍♂️ A significant project that stands out is <strong>Escape Sorcery</strong>: a multiplayer augmented reality game that immerses players in a magical universe. This game requires players to solve puzzles and master spell casting mechanics in a team setting. It features real-world interaction with virtual objects through augmented reality technology, creating an immersive and captivating experience.
